This study analyzed factors affecting women's labor force participation in Latin America and the Caribbean, using UNICEF data and 
hierarchical cluster analysis. The research examined how educational attainment, social policies, and familial responsibilities 
impact women's employment opportunities.

Latin America and the Caribbean were selected as an ideal case study region due to their unique combination of progress and 
persistent challenges in gender equality. The region has made significant strides, achieving approximately 75% gender parity 
according to the World Economic Forum, yet continues to face structural inequities that limit women's access to quality employment.
A key challenge is occupational segregation, with women disproportionately concentrated in traditionally female-dominated sectors 
like care work and services, which often offer lower wages and less job security. This duality of advancement alongside entrenched 
barriers makes the region particularly valuable for examining how familial, social, and educational factors influence women's 
employment choices and for identifying effective policy interventions.


Methodology:

- Data sourced from UNICEF's State of the World's Children dataset
- Variables included labor force participation, educational attainment, and social equity indicators
- Hierarchical cluster analysis employed using Euclidean distance metrics
- Data visualization through heatmaps created with ComplexHeatmap package in R
- Missing data managed through na.omit function
- Variables standardized using scale() function for comparability
- Two separate analyses conducted: educational attainment comparison and social factors impact

Key Findings:

The relationship between education and employment reveals significant gender disparities in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
with women's educational attainment showing a weaker correlation to employment compared to men's, despite similar qualification levels.
While literacy rates demonstrated stronger employment connections than secondary education completion, geographic location emerged 
as a critical factor, with urban areas consistently showing higher female labor participation than rural regions - even in countries 
with robust social support systems. The research identified several key factors positively impacting women's workforce participation: 
access to banking services, maternal benefits including newborn cash support, and universal maternal healthcare.
Conversely, time spent on unpaid domestic work emerged as a significant barrier to labor force participation, highlighting 
how traditional gender roles continue to impact women's economic opportunities regardless of educational achievement or 
geographic location.

Policy Implications:

- Educational access alone insufficient to achieve gender parity
Social support services crucial for enabling workforce participation
Financial inclusion initiatives particularly important

- Rural areas require targeted assistance and policy interventions
Urban-rural disparities need specific policy attention

- Banking access represents a crucial benchmark for achieving gender parity
Financial compensation for mothers can significantly impact labor choices

The study concludes that achieving gender parity in labor markets requires a multi-faceted approach beyond education, 
incorporating financial inclusion, maternal support systems, and reduction of unpaid domestic work burden. 
The hierarchical cluster analysis revealed distinct patterns between countries with comprehensive social support systems 
versus those without, particularly highlighting the impact of financial inclusion and maternal benefits on women's 
workforce participation.
